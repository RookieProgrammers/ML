Retreive features and targets
Merge x_train_features and x_test_featrues to x_featrues
Differentiate object and num featrues from x_features and get their names in tow lists
Imput missing values in x_num features and drop features with missing values(that means drop object features with missing values)
Find object features with nunique smaller than constant c: 
      low_cardinality_cols = [cname for cname in data_x.columns if data_x[cname].nunique()<10 and data_x[cname].dtype == "object"]
